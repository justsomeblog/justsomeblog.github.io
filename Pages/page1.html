      <h5>Saturday, April 16, 2022</h5>
      <h5>Cloudy</h5>
      <p>The snowing finally stopped. The weather is... still pretty wet, but at least it is normal spring weather.</p>
      <p>Regarding course selections, I chose 2 year SL French as recommended by Mr Morneault, HL Math as recommended by literally everyone, and History instead of ITGS, which I actually hesitated for a while. The issue is ITGS is too boring according to Cole, so the verdict goes to history.</p>
      <p>I finished learning differentiation with Jessica. Pretty useful actually, might come in handy later on. I still need to learn integration, but apparently it is harder than differentiation. Anyways, it will work itself out eventually. I also have Seven Chen and Isaac Ho in my HL math class, so it should work out either way.</p>
      <p>The discovery video game is finished. I also entered it into the Heads Cup, which was probably the correct thing to do? The issue is I get exponentially busier because there's a lot more things to prepare as the pitch is next Thursday. The discovery thing also required a video, which I also finished with Leo.</p>
      <p>Playtests were mostly positive with the video game. I rarely say this, but I'm genuinely decently proud of it.</p>
      <p>The debate tournament was decent. I debated Umar's former partner and Team Canada, both were weaker than I imagined. The difficulty of Nats may be easier than I thought it would be.</p>
      <p>I also made it to regionals in chess. Its happening next Sunday, and the Reach For the Top provincials is next Saturday. We are also expecting to jump into exam review pretty soon, so its gonna be a busy sprint until the end of the year.</p>
      <p>We started this new book by Trevor Noah (yes, the comedian who hosts the Daily Show) called Born A Crime. Its pretty interesting and generally well-written, I'm actually surprised. Will have to write more later on after I actually finish the book.</p>
      <p>I was trying to integrate my python game into this site, but I kinda failed. Anyhow, I would post the game download in the next entry if you want to check it out.</p>
      <p>Anyways, its Easter Break, I'm gonna enjoy my life a bit more. Gonna end it here.</p>

      <h5>Snowy</h5>
      <p>I just don't understand how it is still snowing when its near April. Literally it snowed as hard as late November.</p>
      <p>Last week was pretty busy. First off, I determined that I would have to select HL math, as contrary to what I had planned. So I have to decide whether or not I should select HL physics, and if I do, I must give up either HL English or HL History.</p>
      <p>Well, I say I'm determined but I still need to talk to a few more people. Mr Morneault about 1 year French, and Mr Gay about finalising HL Math details. Course selections are due Wednesday so I still have some time, not a lot though.</p>
      <p>Jessica is choosing HL Math. Her previous statement about getting 60s in math exams were misunderstood. Moreover, I read her history essay and it was extraordinarily well-written. The threat level must be raised to the maximum possible, if not exceeding what we have seen previously. The threat is expected to come into dangerous zone next year, but it is also possible for her to perform excessively well this year.</p>
      <p>We started a new project in discovery and I decided to do a video game. Its pretty fun until I have to program 200 lines and its no longer fun. Well, not fun at all. I'm grouping with Leo and Seven, the former responsible for music and the latter for art.</p>
      <p>Oh I also bought a game called Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance. There's a ton of memes about it lately and it gained a lot of traction. I finished it over the weekend. Really nice game, strongly recommend. Have some deep philosophical discussions as well as great action. The best part is it doesn't even need a good PC while having insane graphics. My school computer runs it at 60fps.</p>
      <p>Finally, also signed up for a debate tournament in New Foundland called Simon Lono. The resolution is THW Require That All Pharmaceuticals Be Developed by Government Owned Not-for-profits. Fun.</p>
      <p>It's getting late. I'll end it here.</p>

      <h5>Sunny/Cloudy</h5>
      <p>Made some more decent advancements in robotics. I average around 40-47 points for both starts. I am expecting to make some more progress on Wednesday.</p>
      <p>Band has been officially called off. That's kind of sad seeing we only have had 2 practices this year. However, I'm also glad that it is cancelled because health issues. I do not want to be positive under any circumstances.</p>
      <p>Also, for the clubs on Wednesday, I signed up for chess again but didn't get in. Again. So I end up in JEDI and its not fun at all. I do not like this. Anyways, its only four weeks.</p>
      <p>Masks are gone officially, so this is what my classroom looks like now.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Mar.21,2022.jpg" width="800" height="600"><br>
      <p>Kind of worrying honestly. If one person gets the virus we all get it. My masks provide little to no protection. Maybe I should start wearing that gas mask I bought.</p>
      <p>Jessica got a 7 in Science Lab so the threat level need to be reevaluated.</p>
      <p>Anyways I'll call it here. Not an exciting week but certainly not a bad one either.</p>

      <h5>Sunny</h5>
      <p>School started again. Timezone converted back to daylight saving time, so we're ADT instead of AST now. Because of this we also got 1 hour sleep-in.</p>
      <p>Experienced some side effects after the booster vaccine dose, specifically headache and severe chest pain. The first day after the booster, I experienced slight fever and some decent level of headache, so I didn't get out of my bed for the most part. For the second day, I woke up at 8 because of a severe chest pain that lasted 4-5 hours. No more symptoms is experienced since the 3rd day.</p>
      <p>I just learned that I will be participating in worlds. However, I still need to ask Ms. Wilcox about how stuff works, mainly about recognition and team stuff. In any case, it happens on April 4th, and I will need to spend at least 3 hours per week perparing if I want to go.</p>
      <p>Not much happened in Ukraine. The Russian army is 14 km away from Kyiv, which could signal the end of the war approaching. In either case, the gas prices and the plane ticket prices are extremely high at the moment, which is bad.</p>
      <p>Made it to Senior Nationals in debate with Shreyas Satya as my partner. This could potentially be another good opportunity.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I'll end it here. Need to do some computer engineering work and other reading stuff that I need to do.</p>

      <h5>Monday, March 7, 2022</h5>
      <h5>Cloudy</h5>
      <p class="anger">Term 2 Average GPA: 97.3</p>
      <p>Yup. The report is out. Spring break is also here.</p>
      <p>First of all, LEGO competition on Saturday. I kinda screwed over, not really a good score by any means, but on my defense, I had little time to prepare, and when I did have time to prepare my teammates were never here. So I can't say I'm happy, but I'm certainly not surprised that this is the outcome. I did get quite unlucky though as the score is lower than what I expected.</p>
      <p>Second of all, I had a driver's lesson today (speaking of which I still need to reserve the next lesson before spring break ends). It went well, we went uptown and drove a bit. It was certainly more challenging than ususally, but since I basically mastered turning at this point, it wasn't that much of a challenge.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, Ukraine. Russia's push in Ukraine slowed a bit due to low supplies, international community is sanctioning Russia as hard as possible. However, some stuff I feel like are targeted not towards the government but towards the people. The companies are trying their best to appeal to their global customers by hurting Russians and appealing to the hatred of those customers, who don't care at all if the customers in Russia are hurted. There are several instances of innocent Russian composers or directors or competitors being rejected their recognition because simply they're Russian. This, in my opinion, <strong>is unacceptable.</strong></p>
      <p>Lastly, report card. Leo got 96.7, which creates a small threat (0.6 is still a decent gap), and Jessica didn't get her score back but according to her, she scored 60/100 on a math test so the threat level needs to be re-evaluated. I am genuinely happy with this mark, especially with French, in which I rose from a 92 to a 98. History dropped by 1 point, I would need to talk to McEvoy about that, but it seems like everyone's history is dropping.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I'll go play some Minecraft and relax a bit, just finished working out. I'll write the French homework and take my booster dose of CoVID vaccine tomorrow. I'll end this entry here.</p>

      <h5>Monday, Feb 28, 2022</h5>
      <h5>Sunny</h5>
      <p class="anger">We will never surrender!</p>
      <span class="spoiler-2">The end of the world is here.</span>
      <p>That was quite a bold beginning to the entry... get it? Cuz the text is bolded.</p>
      <p>Anyways, I'm gonna talk about things in chronological orders. Nothing much really happened in my personal life. I spent quite some money on Grammarly premium, which should last until the end of May. Its actually pretty helpful in essays, but sometimes it is also kind of annoying.</p>
      <p>I got the philosophy grade back and I'm quite happy with it. The final overall score is 92/100, which is decent. Also, this means that I can seriously start to prepare for my EE. I sent an email to Ms. Earles about the issue and she hasn't replied yet.</p>
      <p>My EE topic would probably be on the Cultural Revolution. I've read quite some documents, and I'm currently reading a 400 page book titled <em>The History of The Cultural Revolution</em> (《文革史》) published by the Marxist Assocaition of the Peking University (北京大学马克思主义学会), which talks quite in depth about the event and maintains an impartial stance. It is properly sourced and generally a good book. I about halfway through the book, and I'm currently reading 30 pages per day.</p>
      <p><a href="../Documents/the-history-of-the-cultural-revolution.pdf" download target="_blank">Document download</a></p>
      <p>It is also interesting to note that the MAPU was dissolved by the CCP because they were pro-Marxist. <span class="spoiler"><em>Communist</em> Party of China, eh?</span></p>
      <p>Finally, the most important event, and also why I said the world is ending.</p>
      <p><strong>On Feb. 24, 2022, Russia declared a special military operation on Ukraine, claiming denazification as the root cause of this decision and guarateeing independence for parts of Ukraine.</strong></p>
      <p>Ukraine is not yet a part of NATO, which means that they are still vulnerable to attacks. The global community responded harshly, however, it is of no purpose. Currently, 352 people have died, including 14 children. Russia and Ukraine are holding talks at the Ukraine-Belarus border. The Russians are attacking from three sides, the North (which have already advanced to Ukraine's capital, Kyiv), the East (which deals with the area which declares to be independent of Ukraine), and the South (major ports and the black sea).</p>
      <p>Its not an exaggeration to say that if the war continues, Ukraine would not hold off for long. I have also posted something on my wechat account discussing the issue.</p>
      <p>Finally, just yesterady, Putin claimed to have put the Russian nuclear system on high alert, which means that a nuclear war could be imminent. If it happens, the world is going to end. This is nearly as dangerous as the Cuban missile crisis, if not more dangerous, since everyone has better nukes.</p>
      <p>I have no idea what is going to happen. I did not expect the Russians to invade all of a sudden. The oil prices are going to skyrocket, while the stock market would crash. Foreseeably, these few months would be hard.</p>
      <p>Lets see where history leads us on this crossroad. I'll end this entry here and keep on reading.</p>

      <h5>Snowing</h5> 
      <p>Been a while since the last entry. As per promised, there will be a picture this entry.</p>
      <p>First of all, braces don't hurt at all anymore. Upon that, I've established a good dental habit, which would probably stay with me (hopefully) even after I remove the braces.</p>
      <p>Secondly, participated in the National Public Speaking Championships for the first time last weekend (also why I didn't make an entry), it was pretty tiring, but also pretty educational. I realized some of my potentials and limitations, and I have a general idea as to what I should work towards.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, a new studenet arrived in grade 10. Her name's Jessica. She poses a threat to me as she is really good in all her subjects. I would not expect for her to overtake me in the short term, however, this does pose a decent issue in grade 11 and 12. I cannot know her exact strengths until the first report, maybe she is just Beth level, or she could be as good as Leo. Either way, some level of attention is required on her.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, I finished my philosophy course. Finally. As my report is gonna be generated in a few weeks, I would need to tell Ms. Earle what I would need to do in studies. Hopefully I could be permitted to use that time on my EE, specifically the source reading and the outline. I also need to ask Shreyas to see his outline for the EE.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I switched from Bio to Chem in science, I got a 7 in the bio test, which means I should be good in Bio score; and I am gonna start my history essay soon. McEvoy is already letting us start to analyze our sources and make point-form notes, so I believe it shouldn't be too long before we start writing.</p>
      <img src="../Images/Feb.17,2022.png" width="800" height="450"><br>
      <p>By the way, we are switching to online school again for 2 days due to the 9 cases in McKay. That's why I can be writing this at 11 or 12pm. We are expected to return on Tuesday, 22nd Feb. 2022.</p>
      <p>Also VALENTINE'S DAY SUCKED. The school had a bunch of dumb activities, none of which were good. Except for Cole's performance, which was legendary.</p>
      <p>Gotta go sleep now. That was quite a long entry.</p>

      <h5>Raining</h5> 
      <p>Got my braces on. Pure pain. When front teeth collide my brain just stops functioning because the amount of pain I suffer from. Currently taking Advil to avoid my brain from disfunctioning completely.</p>
      <p>Math test tomorrow. Math class started on a new unit, trignometry but its not right angle. Sort of annoying, especially counting the fact that I can't think properly with my braces on.</p>
      <p>Two main issues with the braces that I'm concerned about. One, when I was brushing my teeth today, a blue ring thingy fell out, and I'm not sure if its normal. Two, I feel like a wire is in the way of me biting. Everything else should be normal.</p>
      <p>Already sent the doctor an email about the two aforementioned issues. If she doesn't respond within a day (AKA before tomorrow), I'll wait until Monday to see how things fare out and call the office if the problems persist.</p>
      <p>Made great improvements on the website. Added a comment section and got the page separation done, albeit not in a great manner. Either way, its done. I'll work on improving some stuff later on.</p>
      <p>Completely submitted everything in the philosophy course except for the final assessment. Should be good.</p>
      <p>Not gonna post a photo, at least not for this entry. Maybe the next entry, yes I know its been forever since I've posted a photo.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow is gonna be freezing rain and snow, extreme weather. And I'm supposed to go to sleep early because of the braces. Anyways, I'll end it here.</p>

      <h5>Snowing</h5> 
      <p>Got two more teeth removed. This time it actually hurt a bit and bled more for some reason, I'm not sure. Anyways, I'm writing this entry at like 11 PM, about 10 or 11 hours after the extraction, and its mostly fine now.</p>
      <p>Chewing is mostly unaffected as I'm already used to chewing with my right side despite the missing teeth. The pain isn't especially unbearable as well, its manageable, at least as of right now.</p>
      <p>Oh and also apparently there is no restriction on coke or any soda drink. Never trust google.</p>
      <p>In terms of studying, there are a couple things that I've done. Philosophy course is basically finished, just waiting on the teacher to reply to my drafts and I can start submitting them, and working on the final project which is the presentation.</p>
      <p>There are quite a bit of other work as well. Science is really pressing because I missed the class today and I'm presenting on Tuesday. At least I get Monday off to prepare due to the long weekend.</p>
      <p>We're going back in person next week, which is gonna be interesting. Hopefully my braces doesn't obstruct my experience too much.</p>
      <p>I also started doing physical exercises again. Doing K4 right now, its pretty tiring honestly. I also joined a leftist group chat and we're sharing some documents. Read another 70 pager on Opening up and Reforming + The Cultural Revolution, saved it on my laptop.</p>
      <p><a href="../Documents/opening-up-and-cultural-rev-china.pdf" download target="_blank">Document download</a></p>
      <p>About my future, I figured some stuff out. While I would give all that I have to the cause of the liberation of humanity, some parts in me also want a human life. A life which I could spend time, or in effect, waste time with my family and the ones I love. A life in which I can find someone I love and be with them forever. Such a life is at the expense of the people, I'm aware, but I still have the desire for it. The sense of happiness is simply too attractive. I guess I'm human after all.</p>
      <p>Snowstorm tomorrow again. I'll stay home and do some work with science and English. I'll end this here and try to go to sleep.</p>

      <h5>Sunny</h5> 
      <p>Just got two of my teeth removed. Took about 4 or 5 hours for the effect of the freezer thats used on my teeth to completely wear off. Before it did, I couldn't even drink water properly because the muscles on my lips won't work.</p>
      <p>Tried chewing a bread with only the left side of my mouth, felt kinda weird. I instinctively tried to move the food to the right side because that's how chewing works, but fortunately, its not as painful as I imagined it to be. Moreover, the teeth I removed are not that important to chewing, so all I need to do is just to wait for the wound to heal and everything should be fine.</p>
      <p>There's not much pain honestly, but it is quite uncomfortable. Which hopefully doesn't constitute an issue later on.</p>
      <p>Last week was virtual. It was pretty hectic. Some people just used it as an opportunity to play fortnite and video games (i.e. Alex Symes, Jerry Zhu), but I think I did pretty well in the sense that I wasn't behind or anything. If anything, I was ahead.</p>
      <p>I signed up for the national public speaking tournament, however, I would already have my braces on by then. Hopefully I also have learned to speak normally with them on by then.</p>
      <p>Oh yeah, and I'm also getting decently good at fortnite. Not sure if its a good thing or a bad thing. If anything, I'm not addicted, that's for sure. Not sure how people can get addicted to this game, its not rewarding at all.</p>
      <span class="spoiler">Changed my wechat username to Red Elephant in the Room 房间里的红色大象 and my pfp to a relevant one, as I believe that the major issue of the government is overlooked. But certainly, I still have more learning to do. At this point, I still know too little about the theories and the history.</span><br>
      <p>Anyways, gotta go do some actual work now. Theres a ton of homework this week. I'll end this entry here.</p>

      <h5>Snowstorm</h5> 
      <p>Another snowstorm. I don't even know why it snows so much. Gotta clear off the deck again.</p>
      <p>Dad is painting the bathroom of both the 2nd floor and the 3rd floor, and he is, according to him, also planning on painting the handle of the stairs. Don't get why he's doing all this but I'm fine with it.</p>
      <p>Classes went online due to new policies. It's both good and bad for me. Good in the sense that its safer, bad in the sense that the amount of info conveyed is smaller and I might get a lower grade because its harder to participate in class. Anyways, day 1 seems good, which is at least a good sign.</p>
      <p>Didn't make an entry for provs because it was bullshit. I lost a round because my case "was too good" and got a speaker point of 10. One of my opponents spoke for 1 minute and got the same speaker point. If we won that round, we would be 2nd or even 1st. Now we lost it, and we're 8th. Can't even go to nats. Even McEvoy is pissed. RNS did get a provincial champion for the first time in 5 years though, but it might be taken away by SHERRY NOLAN.</p>
      <p>Anyways, snowing insane outside right now. Gotta eat lunch. Guess I'll end the entry here.</p>

      <p>Snow yesterday was crazy. Gonna snow again tomorrow, another snowstorm. Obviously, school doesn't stop.</p>
      <p>New Brunswick will officially be in Level 3 for CoVID, or the red phase, and of course, RNS is unphased. Co-curricular might stop though.</p>
      <p>It seems that the students in grade 12 would rather risk it than to go online (Yihong, Cindy). There's also the boarders. I have to admit that shutting down is not as easy as it sounds. Omicron is also not that much of a worry for us. However, community spread could be lethal.</p>
      <p>Fortunately, my dad will be getting his booster in March. Hopefully I don't give him the virus before then.</p>
      <p>Debate tournament in 2 days. I'll probably make a separate entry for that.</p>

      <p>7668 active cases until today, 122 hospitalizations, 10 on ventilators. And SOMEHOW, RNS decides to still go back in person.</p>
      <p>Finished the debate case & went over it with Shreyas today, he can finish Gov case within 5 minutes, which is pretty good, despite he still stutters a little. We should be better at the time of the actual tournament.</p>
      <p>People came to fix the window of the bathroom on the 3rd floor and my dad's bedroom today, it couldn't remain open. Now it can and it looks a lot better. Took about 4 hours (8:15 AM - around 12 PM).</p>
      <p>Regarding RNS and covid again. Cole said that the reason we're going back in person could be that RNS remaining open during the pandemic was a big selling factor for some new families this year, and I think also that they need to refund us if its in-person. Nothing beats in-person school, my ass. Just pure capitalism.</p>
      <p>Some people are coming back from Mexico, some from Toronto, some from other places. We're gonna have the biggest outbreak ever tomorrow. There's no way I go to eat lunch, despite McEvoy telling me that there will not be mandatory lunch. Not taking off my mask any time tomorrow. I'll try and find a KN95 as well so I don't have to switch it midway.</p>
      <p>Let's see if I survive.</p>

      <p>The snowstorm was insane, see picture below. Never seen it snow this much in my entire life. Spent like 2 hours clearing off just the back yard, back hurts like hell. Never doing it again.</p>
      <p style="text-decoration: line-through;">Global warming is fake</p>
      <p>That was a joke if you didn't realize. Anyways, I finished the government case for debate, and before my philosophy teacher responds to my email I won't be doing philosophy in the forseeable future. School starts soon so there's always that.</p>
      <p>Might get on the Hypixel SMP a bit before school starts. Finish that nether railroad.</p>

      <h5>Snowstorm</h5> 
      <p>This post will be in Mandarin.</p>
      <p>怎么说也过了一年半左右了。前年十月份那会那种天塌了的感觉也不会再有了，毕竟比当时成熟了嘛。但是今天看到你还在关心我们的视频真是忍不住哭了。</p>
      <p>怎么说呢…前年七月份还是六月份那会吧，因为回不去国内，在这边也没什么朋友，每天负能量叠加到最后脑子里想到的只有各种死法。大概也是在那个时候读的自杀手册。不过后来偶然在b站刷到了你的视频，记得是“夏色祭狂笑十分钟耐久”来着wwww。</p>
      <p>当时想到的就是这个东西好蠢，然而不知不觉就关注起来了。夏色祭呼吸也好，伤心也好，交朋友也好，从一开始仅仅觉得很有趣到真正投入情感的转变真的很快。嘛，我也没花什么真金白银就是了。</p>
      <p>究竟是什么东西吸引了我，我也不清楚。然而每天晚上十一点（时差党www）等着协会更新仿佛给了我一点希望。每天开始锻炼，学习，读书，出门打球，和朋友聊天，似乎生活一点点回到正轨了。真了不起呢，夏色祭。</p>
      <p>然后看直播的时候都会算时差然后想“这个时间点还直播真的不要紧么”，感觉就像老父亲一样ww。夏色祭大概已经成为我生活的一部分了吧。之前那种阴暗的感觉已经没有了，真了不起呢，夏色祭。</p>
      <p>然后就开学了，对我而言倒也没什么区别。一个月后那件事发生了。当时就是祈祷着不要让事态扩张到不可控制的地步，然而还是发生了。我们还是说了再见。在那几周都不在状态，倒也可以理解吧，毕竟生活的重要组成部分被夺走了。</p>
      <p>那个时候的光消失了。然而对我而言也没什么大不了，我当时已经从那个黑暗的深渊里爬出来了。然而几个月后，对死亡的恐惧又战胜了我，把我拉回了更黑暗的深渊。</p>
      <p>记不清是十一月的什么时候了，我用水果刀对着自己的脖子大概有半个小时吧，最后还是放下了。不管是老师，同学，朋友，还是家人都没人在乎这件事情。好几个月都无法走出那种阴暗的感觉，说不定现在也还在影响着我呢。当时也时不时的会想，如果你还在的话就好了。</p>
      <p>也曾经试着去看老视频来治愈自己，然而带来的只有更深的抑郁和怀旧。不过幸好最后还是靠自己走了出来，现在怀着更坚定的信仰准备继续走下去。恩，我也很了不起呢。</p>
      <p>嘛，关于我的故事也说的够多了。……真是个傻瓜呢，夏色祭。如果没有看到那个视频的话，至今为止都会以为你是主动离开的吧。为什么要让自己这么不好受啊。明明和你的同事们一样放下我们继续去赚钱不就好了，这部本身就是份工作嘛，哪有干出感情的啊……笨蛋</p>
      <p>是不是脑子坏掉了啊……真是的。国内的这些人对自己大大咧咧的，然而对你却比什么都心细啊。以后的路就要你自己走了，多加小心啊，傻成这个样子可不行……祭以后可不能继续当笨蛋了，要说好了哦</p>
      <p>那就这样吧。如果可以的话，期待下一次与你相见时那一句元气的“夏色祭参上“。如果不能再见的话，那么祝你前程似锦，人生顺利。不管走什么样的道路我都会支持你的。</p>
      <p>那么。夏色祭，一路顺风。</p>

      <p>Not much happened. Had my second driving lesson, coach is feeling better and said I need to practice turning more. Finish the philosophy unit. I'm writing this at 1 AM in the morning.</p>
      <p>The reason I'm still up at this hour is Sherry Nolan, she changed the debate resolution for provincials to something new completely. Prepping my ass off right now.</p>
      <p>0 Ground for government case. I don't even know how she can persistently come up with new trashier resolutions. Sherry Nolan never fails to disappoint. Here's a pic of what I have so far.</p>

      <p>Also, snowstorm tomorrow. Gonna grind my case I guess, originally planning to go practice driving at QPlex.</p>

      <p>Literally nothing happened today. French class happened. I made this entry to remind myself of how bad covid is. I will write the following in two languages.</p>
      <p>Covid can and have (from the very 1st case) affect other organs than the lungs and the respiratory system. Cases have been reported where covid affected the brain. It is also possible that covid cannot be detected by any means of covid testing that exists in the present day. In fact, covid tests are only 50% accurate. All vaccines are void against the omicron variant. A woman died in LA 4 days after contracting the virus, showing 0 symptoms whatsoever and her dead body tested negative for covid, she died from a cerebral hemorrhage.</p>
      <p>新冠病毒可以影响呼吸系统以外的器官。武汉第一例病例脑髓液就测出了新冠病毒。核酸和其他检测方式至多50%有效，多例无症状感染者可因新冠而脑出血死亡。疫苗针对最新的奥米克隆变种几乎完全无效。LA女人病例，尸体核酸阴性，且感染病毒后四天内完全无症状暴毙，死因是脑出血。</p>
      <p>Stay safe.</p>

      <h5>Raining</h5> 
      <p>Aaaaand of course it rains today when everyone thinks the snow can finally pile up for a bit.</p>
      <p>Went to someone else's place (海平阿姨) with some friends today for Lunch. Got really bored later because there were literally nothing to do, so I finished my daily dose of philosophy course there instead. Finally moved on to communism and socialism, the course isn't too biased.</p>
      <p>Prepped some debate after I got home. Dinner is leftover pizza. Tried K3 for the first time in a while, got destroyed, but its possible. Next goal is K3 but with shorter breaks.</p>
      <p>The anime yesterday really made me consider some life choices. I really miss the times when I'm younger, and I realized just how much I've been wasting my time.</p>
      <p>First day in 2022. At least I'll have a chance to change. Life is much less desirable now when compared to 10 years or even 5 years ago, but I still have a chance to change. Gotta enjoy life as is. I bet 5 or 10 years later I'll be looking back and be envious of myself right now.</p>
      <p>Obviously, this is not to say that my life is desirable or enjoyable. However, as things only go downhill, I might as well take what I can and keep it in my memory.</p>
      <p>So yeah. That anime was really good btw. Its name is Erased（只有我不在的街道）, if you didn't see the third entry.</p>

      <p>Helped my dad clean the back yard of snow this morning. Fixed some issues with the blog. Finished correcting philosophy essays. Did some further research regarding debate.</p>
      <p>Played minecraft. Watched anime, which I will get to in a bit. Dinner was veggie pizza and meat, delicious as always.</p>
      <p>The debate topic this time ("This House would support a ban on cryptocurrency") is sort of hard to prep for. I have no idea what crypto is, but now I generally have something along the lines of a case. Talking to Shreyas, my partner, on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Regarding the anime, it's called Erased（只有我不在的街道）, recommended by Umar. It was really good. Finished it in an afternoon, about 12 episodes. The plot was near perfect.</p>
      <p>还有你们能不能别再说什么范式狂喜，牛头人之类的啊，这东西跟牛头人根本不沾边好吧，怎么看八代和男主都没什么浪漫感情啊，差不多一点啊你们这些人，我都哭了然后看评论区全是“牛头人”真的很破坏气氛啊喂</p>
      <p>Happy new year! Next year I'll be someone else. I will work harder. I will push myself harder. Most importantly, I'll be a better person. Those are my resolutions.</p>
      <br><p>Oh and also, I feel like I can start doing the K3 from the Keep App tomorrow in temrs of physical exercise.</p>

      <p>Sleepy as heck, tried for an afternoon to add pages to this website and failed. Formatting error. Guess I'll use collapse instead for now.</p>
      <p>Did some more philosophy work and carried on with my daily routine. All should be good. Driving class got cancelled because teacher was sick. Hopefully its not CoVID.</p>

      <p>Finished some stuff in my philosophy course. Carried on my daily routine.</p>
      <p>Dinner was delicious. Ate some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanghulu" target="_blank">Chinese dessert</a>, maybe I need to work out more.</p>
      <p>Finished the book Mao's Great Famine. Have a few opinions on it that I need to tell McEvoy.</p>
