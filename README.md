# Richard (PlanePaper)'s Blog

# Sorry, but this blog has been officially closed. The source code remains here for the memories

## FAQs (Not really *frequently* asked, just questions and answers I thought could be helpful)

### Why was this blog closed?
I got tired of updating the chunky source code every time I wanted to write something. Also, most of the time I had little to say. The website also fails to reflect my web-development skills and it's getting a bit embarrassing. Finally, and most importantly, I didn't really feel comfortable telling the entire truth about my life on a public site anymore.

Sorry.

### Where can I see more similar things?

...Ok, if someone out there actually wants to see more of *this* for whatever reason (kinda creepy ngl, but whatever), I have another site where I put stuff I write. It is [here](https://justsomewriting.github.io). It is much more formal and well-formatted. I will keep maintaining that for the foreseeable future as it is the only way for me to publish my writing, and I like writing quite a lot.

### Will you reuse this blog in the future?

Probably not. Sorry again.
